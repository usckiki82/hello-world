# Output Folder

This is the folder for outputting data from kaggle projects.
Data will be outputted to a folder with the project name under 
this output folder.  For instance, all output related files 
for the project "titanic" should show up in a folder "titanic"
in the output folder.  Note that the folder name will match 
the project name within the kaggle-code structure.
