# Data Folder

This is the folder for adding data sets to be used in analysis.
You need to add a folder with the project name under this data
folder and then add the files to that project folder.  For 
instance, download the titanic data files from kaggle and then
add to a "titanic" folder within this data folder.  Note that
the file name needs to match the package name within the 
kaggle-code structure.
